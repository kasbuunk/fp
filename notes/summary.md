### 1.2: Functional programming

Functional programming is a style of programming in which the basic method of computation is application of functions to arguments.

A functional programming language is one that supports and encourages the functional style.

The difference between a mutable variable in imperative languages and a mathematical variable is that the former can have its value changed during the execution of the program, whilst the latter remains constant once it has been bound at the function application.
