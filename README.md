# Functional Programming

This project documents the learning progress for a university course on Functional Programming at the Open Universiteit Nederland. Via Test-Driven Development (TDD) I progress through the chapters of Graham Hutton's book on Functional Programming with Haskell.

## Prerequisites

- [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/): The Haskell Tool Stack

## Run tests

```sh
stack test
```
